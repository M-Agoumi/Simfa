# background
Simfa started as a school project, I was tasked with creating an instagram like website, but I wasn't allowed to use any framework, miniframework or library I didn't write myself, and since php with mvc gets a bit messy, I wanted to avoid that, so that was the start of simfa which grow to what it's today, this repository isn't maintanted it yet, corrently I fix the bugs in camagru repository, once I validat my project I will update simfa with the latest version and with the bug fixes, thank you.
